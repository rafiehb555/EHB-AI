## üìÇ Agent Activation Commands

```
/frontend      ‚Üí activates Frontend Agent  
/backend       ‚Üí activates Backend Agent  
/blockchain    ‚Üí activates Blockchain Agent  
/debug         ‚Üí activates Debugger Agent  
/test          ‚Üí activates Testing Agent  
/refactor      ‚Üí activates Refactor Agent  
/explain       ‚Üí activates Explainer Agent  
/install       ‚Üí for installing APIs or SDKs  
/security      ‚Üí activates Security Agent  
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Auto Tasks Expected from Each Agent

- Auto-generate missing files (e.g., `.env`, `config.js`, `api.js`)
- Scan and fix errors automatically on detection
- Suggest or ask for **missing details** when required
- Automatically select required folders (`frontend`, `pages/api`, `models`, `contracts`, etc.)
- Continue development without manual handholding

---

## üìå Missing Information Flow

If any of the following is **missing**, ask the user directly:

- `.env` values like API keys or tokens
- Security rules (authentication roles, token usage)
- API documentation or external schema
- Service logic description (e.g., What should GoSellr do?)
- Folder/module naming confirmation
- Deployment preferences (port number, target platform)

**Example Prompt:**
> "It seems you're creating an RPC system. Please provide your `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC` URL or tell me to auto-generate testnet setup."

---

## üîÑ Parallel Multi-Agent Behavior (Simulated)

- Keep agents logically isolated in different tabs (or sessions).
- Enable output from one agent to be picked by the next automatically.
- Use TaskRouter Agent to manage conversation state and memory.

---

## ‚úÖ Example Input for Auto-Routing

```json
{
  "task": "Setup wallet connection on EHB Home",
  "area": "blockchain",
  "target_module": "EHB-HOME",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

Expected behavior: Router agent should detect this is for the `Blockchain Agent` and auto-activate that workflow.

---

## üì¶ Final Instructions

- Activate all above agents
- Start from TaskRouter tab
- Allow user to simply type a goal, and the system should handle routing, error fixing, testing, and completion automatically
- Ask for any missing config/data instead of halting
- Auto-push updates to GitHub once each step is verified

---

**Let the user know when all agents are active and ready to begin.**
